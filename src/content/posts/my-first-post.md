## Daily Security Operations  

Every day starts with updatesâ€”patching, refining scripts, and tightening security configurations. I run a set of custom scripts to automate checks, ensuring backend servers are hardened and running smoothly.  

## Backend Config & Automation  

From setting up secure environments to fine-tuning server defenses, automation is key. Scripts handle logging, monitoring, and threat detection, keeping everything efficient and secure.  

## Current Project  

One of my ongoing projects is focused on **offensive security research**â€”building and testing security tools to stay ahead of emerging threats.
