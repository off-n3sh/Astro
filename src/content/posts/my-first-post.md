## Exam Tips

    Create a good and easy-to-search cheatsheet. I used Joplin, and its global search was amazing. Everything I learned went there, and after some time, I did quick reviews. Having all key commands and techniques in one place saved me a lot of time during the exam.

    Focus on your weak points. In my case, it was Windows privilege escalation and AD. But during my preparation, I spent half my time on Linux machines, which I was already confident in. This almost cost me the exam.

    Take good notes and screenshots of everything. This will save you a lot of time during the exam.

    Never give up. When the exam starts, set a timer. If you feel like you’re failing, look at it and remind yourself, “I still have 20 hours, it just started.” Don’t focus on the 4 hours that have passed. Focus on what’s ahead.

    Take regular breaks. Keeping your brain fresh helps you come up with new ideas.

    Test the tools you expect to use before the exam. You don’t want to waste valuable exam time troubleshooting BloodHound or any other tool.
